# NFT-preview-card-component

## Description

I have seen this project on Frontend Mentor and i will be using the skills i have learned from my front end web development bootcamp to complete it. I will be using HTML and CSS to complete it. I will be adding hover state and other forms of design to complete the task.

The challange give me a design guide for colours, images and sizing. Instead of using 'px' for font sizing, i will be using 'em' as i want to start using different design/coding fundementals.
